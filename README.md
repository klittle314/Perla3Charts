Rmarkdown for Perla et al. style charts to illustrate importance of time order
Perla, R. J., Provost, L. P., Murray, S. K. The run chart: a simple analytical tool for learning from variation in healthcare processes. 
BMJ Quality & Safety, 2011, 20, pp.Â 46-51 showed a triplet of graphs that have identical summary statistics.

They make the point that time order is critical for causal analysis in quality improvement.

I created an RMarkdown script to generate examples similar to their presentation, allowing the user to create graphs with "up" or "down" as the good direction and to customize labels to match a user's situation.
